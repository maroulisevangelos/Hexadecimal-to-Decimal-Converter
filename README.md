# Hexadecimal-to-Decimal-Converter
This project is an implementation of a hexadecimal to decimal converter using MIPS assembly language. The program reads four hexadecimal characters, packs them into a register, converts them to their decimal equivalent, and prints the result.

Features
  ✅ Reads four hexadecimal characters as input
  ✅ Packs them into a single register
  ✅ Converts the hexadecimal value to decimal
  ✅ Displays the decimal equivalent on the console
  ✅ Includes error handling for invalid input

Usage
  Run the program on SPIM or MARS MIPS simulator
  Input four valid hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F)
  The program outputs the corresponding decimal value
  
This project was completed as part of the Computer Systems Organization course during the Winter Semester 2021-2022.
